                    I am a full stack developer with a background in web development, marketing, and graphic design. I've seen the details 
                    that make the difference. We've all come across a program, a piece of software, or a website where we thought, 
                    "Ugh....I wish it did this" or "NO!!! Why are you doing that?!". Details matter and can make or break the experience 
                    for a user. With my knowledge in development, marketing, and design, I can bridge the gaps in communication and 
                    bring to life the details that matter to you and your users.

                <p>
                    When I'm not outside playing with my 3 dogs or watching a true crime show with my wife, I like to study up on my craft and 
                    continue to grow as a developer. I also love trying out new restaurants and finding local parks to take walks in and enjoy 
                    nature. I'm a huge fan of comedy in all mediums and I enjoy learning about everything from the human body and nutrition, to 
                    technology and the universe.
